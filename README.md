##Sales Data Analysis with SQL
### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales transaction data stored in an Excel file. The dataset includes key attributes such as transaction IDs, sale dates and times, customer demographics, product categories, quantities sold, prices, and sales revenue. By importing the data into a SQL database, I performed various analyses to derive insights and answer specific business questions. The project highlights the power of SQL for data analysis and demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to practice and demonstrate SQL skills by analyzing real-world sales data. The analysis includes filtering, aggregating, and deriving insights to address critical business questions such as sales trends, customer behavior, and performance of product categories. Key goals include:

Identifying sales patterns across time periods.
Segmenting customers based on purchase behavior.
Determining the best-selling products and categories.
Calculating metrics like average sales, total sales, and customer age distribution.
Queries and Analysis
The project involved the following SQL queries:

Retrieve Sales Data by Date: Identify all transactions made on a specific date (2022-11-05).
Category-Based Sales Analysis: Filter transactions where the category is "Clothing" and quantities sold exceed 10 in November 2022.
Total Sales by Category: Calculate total sales for each product category.
Customer Demographics: Determine the average age of customers who purchased items from the "Beauty" category.
High-Value Transactions: Find all transactions where the total sale amount exceeds 1000.
Gender-Based Transactions: Count the number of transactions made by each gender within each category.
Monthly Sales Trends: Calculate average monthly sales and identify the best-selling month for each year.
Top Customers: Identify the top 5 customers based on total sales volume.
Unique Customers by Category: Count the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of SQL for data analysis and provides valuable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. Key findings include:

Identification of top-performing categories and high-value customers.
Analysis of sales trends by month and category.
Insights into customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
The project also showcases the ability to derive actionable insights from raw data, which can help businesses make informed decisions and optimize sales strategies.
